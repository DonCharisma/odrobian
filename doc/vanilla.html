<h1>Vanilla Section</h1>

<p>This section will specifically contain information about using the headless version of this distribution. I would like to state also that governor & underclocking options are working as well the same way as the desktop version.</p>

<h3>Automatic Network Settings</h3>

<p>This is already configured for you by default through DHCP starting from ODROBIAN 2.0, just make sure you have Ethernet connection during boot or else it will get stuck waiting for "eth0" to come up. Otherwise, just disable the "eth0" interface inside "/etc/network/interfaces" before booting the system, like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>	odroid:# nano /etc/network/interfaces</code>
</pre>

<p>Find these configurations at the end of the "interfaces" file then delete, modify or add to them, do whatever you want.</p>

<pre>
<code>
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Set Network Hostname</h3>

<p>It's already set to "odroid" by default however, you will be able to generate an unique host name which is great for using multiple odroids on the same network "odrobian-MAC" with a simple command.</p>

<pre>
<code>
	Make sure you have ODROBIAN Hook:
	odroid:$ sudo -s
	odroid:# apt-get update && apt-get install oh-utils

	odroid:# oh --gen-hostname
	
	*This command will automatically restart your system.

	Change Hostname Manually with ODROBIAN Hook:
	odroid:# oh --gui
</code>
</pre>
 
 <p>Then navigate to option number "11" from the GUI called "Change Hostname" while a dialog will appear asking you to type the new name, If you are looking to assign a custom hostname the classical way, you can change it manually afterwards if you wish, you only need to edit the following two files created inside the /etc/* path:</p>

 <pre>
 <code>
	odroid:# nano /etc/hosts
	odroid:# nano /etc/hostname
	odroid:# reboot
</code>
</pre>

<p>Look for either "odrobian-MAC" or "odroid" inside each file and change it to whatever hostname you desire then restart your system to take effect.</p>

<h3>Enable USB Automount for Vanilla</h3>

<p>If you are not willing to install any desktop environments which should have "USB Automount" feature enabled by default, you can make the pure Debian automount your USB drivers/disks automatically by specifying the automount points.</p>

<pre>
<code>
	odroid:# nano /etc/usbmount/usbmount.conf
</code>
</pre>

Look for:

<pre>
<code>
MOUNTPOINTS=""
</code>
</pre>

Replace with:

<pre>
<code>
MOUNTPOINTS="/media/usb0 /media/usb1 /media/usb2 /media/usb3
             /media/usb4 /media/usb5 /media/usb6 /media/usb7"
</code>
</pre>

<p>After, that all USB drives/disks should be automounted to the configured mountpoints you have at "/media/*" path.</p>

<h3>Install Desktop Environment</h3>

<p>Please note that Vanilla will have a first boot setup process so it will resize your rootfs partition to be expanded to your SD card maximum size and regenerate the SSH keys automatically as well for you for better networking capability. If you are not having too much experience, you can install desktop environments and other essential server software through basic GUI with the Tasksel which is included by default in Debian.</p>

<pre>
<code>
	Prepare environment:
	odroid:# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
	
	Run Installation GUI:
	odroid:# tasksel
	odroid:# apt-get install mali-x11
	odroid:# reboot
</code>
</pre>

<p>Taskel is a graphical interface to install your favourite desktop environment easily.</p>
