	ODROBIAN 1.X for s805 - Changelog
==================================================

This change log will be updated right after testing and evaluating an image so please give feedback and suggestions to improve the next release with more updates, optimizations and fixes so then I can release a new image again. Also, I will always announce my progress for the upcoming releases here:

Odrobian 1.2 (FINAL) - Stable Release
-This release is integrated perfectly with our repository so you will receive updates remotely.
-HardKernel trusty repository is no longer used as we're relying on our own one optimized for ODROIDs running under Debian Jessie.
-Installed an Odrobian Platform deb package now that contains our custom scripts and mods to be updated.
-Bootloader (u-boot) is upgraded to latest version and it's now installed as a deb package to be updated.
-Included boot.ini file and other C1 specific scripts required on boot like C1_init fix are installed as a deb package to be updated.
-Mali Video xorg driver is now installed as a deb package to be updated from repository as well.
-SSH host keys regeneration is now done only once during the First Boot process instead of (rc.local) booting up.
-This image is now uploaded on the repository server hosted by @mdrjr as a direct link thankfully.
-More are coming on the way through the repository.

Starting from this point, here's how you can receive updates with simple commands same as the official HardKernel distribution:

    odroid:$ sudo apt-get update
    odroid:$ sudo apt-get upgrade (Latest software optimized for ODROIDs)
    odroid:$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (Latest odrobian kernel and bootloader)


If you have Odrobian 1.1 and don't want to re-download, there's a way for how to upgrade to Odrobian 1.2 FINAL, open up a terminal window (Ctrl + T):

    odroid:$ sudo su
    odroid:# rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/odroid.list
    odroid:# wget http://oph.mdrjr.net/odrobian/sources.list/odrobian-main-s805.list
    odroid:# mv odrobian-main-s805.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    odroid:# wget -O- http://oph.mdrjr.net/odrobian/public-key.asc | apt-key add -
    odroid:# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
    odroid:# apt-get remove linux-image-odrobian-c1
    odroid:# apt-get install linux-image-odrobian-s805 odrobian-platform-s805 bootini fix-w1-blacklist u-boot xserver-xorg-video-mali
    odroid:# cd /usr/share/c1_uboot && sudo ./sd_fusing.sh /dev/mmcblk0
    odroid:# reboot
