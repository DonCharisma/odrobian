Save of Odroid Odrobian repository from WayBackMachine

Disclaimer - Please note I won't be updating or maintaining this repository, if you want that then please feel free to fork, or create your own. I won't be able to answer any questions either, as I'm neither the maintainer, or an expert on any of this.

Why ? I have two Odroid C1 boards, recently went to update software and discovered Odroid had deleted this repository, presumably because C1 is now "old" and they don't want to support it anymore. It appears also that the Odrobian package maintainer has "disapeared".

I, and I imagine some others may want to use this software, so I have retrieved as best I can the latest files from WayBackMachine (archive.org) and uploaded them here. ( Using https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader )

Of particular use is the OS images, and the "oh-utils", and documents.

# Odrobian OS Images

Due to github filesize limits, images have been split in a .rar container, and you will therefore need to use rar software in order to obtain the orginal .xz file.
